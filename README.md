# FACIAL_EMOTIONS_RECOGNITION
Here we have 13690 images of various faces along with their expressions in .jpg format . We first converted the .jpg format file into csv format . Then we applied CNN with keras . The architecture consists of two convulational layes which is using relu as activation fuction along with the two pooling layers. After that flatten images are passed into the two dense layer and the result is produced. The activation layers of the dense layers are relu and softmax respectively.To reduce overfitting we are using Adam as the optimizer and categorical cross entropy as our loss function. The model is producing the testing accuracy as 67%.
